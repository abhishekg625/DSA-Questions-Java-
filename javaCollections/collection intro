Question- what is collections in java?
Answer- Java Collection is a framework  in which java itself built 
some important Data Structures, which are very highly optimised.
its makes easier to implement these Data Structure in our programme,
 Java Collection include interfaces like (List, map etc) and Classes to 
 implement these interfaces Like (ArrayList, Stack and queue etc)
 
 List Interface--
 1- ArrayList
 2-Linked List
 3- Vector
 4- stack
 
 Set Interface--               
 1-HashSet
 2- LinkedHashSet
 
 Queue Interface--
 1-Priority Queue
 2-Dequeue
 3- ArrayDequeue
 
 #Sorted Set
 1-TreeSet
 
 
 
 #Arrays and its methods in Collection
1-- int binarySearch(int array[ ], int value)--> perform  binary search
2--The copyOf( )--> returns copy of array
3--static boolean[ ] copyOfRange(boolean[ ] source, int start, int end)---> return copy in range
4--boolean equals(char array1[ ], char array2[ ])-- compare two array 
5-- sort(int array[ ], int start, int end)--> sort started to begning
